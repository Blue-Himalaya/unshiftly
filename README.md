## Overview ##
  > A client tasked us with developing a web app with capabilities to provide himself and his employees with the ability to keep track of weekly scheduling. He was struggling with juggling all the individual employee's shifts and requests for time off on daily basis.
  <br/><br/>
  We developed a CRUD appliction withh a RESTful API allowing administrative users to successfully read and write schedules weekly. Along with the ability for non-administrators to view only their particular schedules and pick up shifts that their coworkers have dropped. This was done by adding single-step authentication in the form of Passport.js and Bcrypt.
